must:

add AI
verslag

extra:

add tilehover graphics
add different cursor when attacking or a menu
add character animations (like move/attack/beinghit) / SFX
add objects to field
add more units (archery/mage)
add special attacks
add other game mode
add items (increase stats)
when no moves left and selecting active unit, make neighbour tiles different colour (same with friendlies you cant go to)
layers so not everything has to be redrawn each frame?

kind of unimportant:

not all maps work? (because it's checking each tile) (doesn't really matter)
make code clean //Arborea.grid / Points/hashmap
get money
